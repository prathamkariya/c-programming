## About Me

My name is **Pratham Kariya**, and I am a student of **PDEU (Pandit Deendayal Energy University)** pursuing **Computer Engineering, Batch of 2029**.

This repository / collection contains all the **C programming codes** that I practiced and wrote while learning the fundamentals of C language.

It includes programs from all major topics such as:

* Variables, Data Types, Operators
* Conditional Statements
* Loops (for, while, do-while)
* Functions (with and without arguments, return values)
* Recursive functions
* Arrays (1D & 2D)
* Strings
* Pointers
* Structures & Unions
* File Handling
* Practice problems and lab assignments

Each program was created as part of my learning process to understand C syntax, logic building, memory concepts, and core programming fundamentals.

## Purpose of This Collection

The purpose of this collection is to:

* Track my progress while learning C programming.
* Keep all lab programs and practice codes organized.
* Help future students or anyone beginning with C to use these codes as reference.
* Serve as a personal learning portfolio.

## How to Compile & Run (GCC)

```bash
gcc filename.c -o program
./program
```

## Final Note

These programs reflect my personal journey of learning C programming from scratch. They helped me build strong fundamentals which will support me throughout the Computer Engineering course.

If you are viewing this as a fellow student — feel free to use these codes for practice and understanding, but always try writing your own logic first.
